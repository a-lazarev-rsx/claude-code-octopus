# Cimetry Epic Description in Table Format

| **Section** | **Description** | **Questions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Project Name** | Cimetry - TeamCity Analytics Platform |  |
| **Problem Statement** | Development and QA teams lack comprehensive insights into TeamCity builds and test execution, leading to: • Delayed identification of test failures and patterns • Manual analysis of build results consuming significant time • Inability to track quality trends over time • No predictive capabilities for build/test failures • Lack of team-specific performance metrics | _What problem are we solving?_ Insufficient visibility and analytics for CI/CD quality metrics _Who is affected and how?_ • Development teams - manual analysis of failures • QA teams - reactive problem identification • Management - lack of quality insights _What specific issue is being solved?_ Absence of intelligent analytics platform for TeamCity data _Who are the stakeholders affected?_ All R&D teams using TeamCity |
| **Background & Context** | TeamCity provides raw build and test data but lacks advanced analytics capabilities. Teams spend hours manually analyzing logs, identifying patterns, and tracking quality metrics. As the codebase and number of tests grow, this manual approach becomes unsustainable. | _From where we started?_ Manual analysis of TeamCity logs and results _What led to the current situation?_ • Growing number of tests and builds • Increased complexity of test suites • Need for data-driven quality decisions • Lack of built-in analytics in TeamCity |
| **Goal & Criteria. Proposed Solution** | **Goal:** Create a comprehensive analytics platform that provides intelligent insights into TeamCity builds and tests **Achievement criteria:** 1. 50% reduction in time spent on manual test analysis 2. Automated pattern recognition for test failures 3. Real-time quality dashboards for all teams 4. Predictive analytics for build success/failure 5. AI-powered error analysis and clustering **Proposed solution:** Multi-service platform with backend API (FastAPI), modern frontend (Next.js), and AI integration (LLM service) | _What is the final goal?_ Automated, intelligent analytics for all TeamCity data _What is the expected result?_ • Faster issue resolution • Proactive quality management • Data-driven decisions • Improved test reliability _What is the proposed approach?_ Microservices architecture with AI integration |
| **Strategic Impact** | This project directly supports company's quality excellence goals by: • Improving software quality through data-driven insights • Reducing time-to-market with faster issue resolution • Enabling predictive quality assurance • Providing competitive advantage through advanced analytics | _How does the project support strategy?_ • Quality excellence initiative • Digital transformation goals • Operational efficiency targets _What benefits will it create?_ • Cost reduction (less manual work) • Quality improvement (faster fixes) • Better resource allocation • Increased customer satisfaction |
| **Alternatives Considered** | • Commercial CI/CD analytics tools - expensive and not TeamCity-specific • Building reports in TeamCity - limited capabilities, no AI features • Manual dashboards in BI tools - no real-time updates, high maintenance • Status quo - unsustainable with growing scale | _What other solutions were evaluated?_ Commercial tools, in-house BI solutions, TeamCity plugins _What are the trade-offs?_ • Build vs buy decision • Integration complexity • Maintenance overhead • Customization needs |
| **Implementation Plan** | **Phase 1 (Completed):** Core platform development • Backend API with TeamCity integration • Frontend with dashboards • Basic analytics features **Phase 2 (Completed):** Production deployment • Docker containerization • LDAP authentication • Performance optimization **Phase 3 (In Progress):** AI Integration • LLM service deployment • Error pattern analysis • Predictive analytics **Phase 4 (Planned):** Advanced features • Security enhancements • Extended analytics • Multi-tenant support | _What are the main stages?_ 1. Core development 2. Production deployment 3. AI integration 4. Advanced features _What are the timelines?_ • Phase 1-2: Completed • Phase 3: Q3 2025 • Phase 4: Q4 2025 |
| **Resource Requirements** | • **Teams:** Platform team (backend/frontend), AI/ML team, DevOps • **Infrastructure:** Docker hosts, PostgreSQL, SQL Server access • **Tools:** TeamCity API access, LLM infrastructure (Ollama/OpenRouter) • **Budget:** Mainly internal resources + infrastructure costs | _Which teams are needed?_ Platform development, AI/ML, DevOps _What budget is required?_ Infrastructure and LLM API costs _What is the timeline?_ Through end of 2025 |
| **Success Metrics & KPIs** | **Operational Metrics:** 1. Analysis time reduction: 50% decrease 2. Issue detection speed: 30% faster 3. Test suite optimization: 20% reduction in execution time 4. Pattern detection accuracy: 80%+ 5. User adoption: 90% of teams actively using **Business Impact:** • Reduced QA costs • Improved product quality • Faster release cycles • Higher customer satisfaction | _Operational Metrics_ See detailed list _How will this impact business?_ • ROI through time savings • Quality improvement metrics • Faster time-to-market _How will this improve UX?_ • Intuitive dashboards • Actionable insights • Automated recommendations |
| **Stakeholders** | • **Affected by the project:** All R&D teams, QA engineers, Team leads • **Interested in the project:** Product management, Customer Success • **Having influence:** VP Engineering, Head of QA, CTO • **Key stakeholders:** - Andrew Lazariev (Assignee/Project Owner) - QA Tech Leads - Development Team Leads - DevOps team | _Who is affected?_ All TeamCity users in R&D _Who is interested?_ Management, Product teams _Who has influence?_ Technical leadership _Key stakeholders?_ See list |
