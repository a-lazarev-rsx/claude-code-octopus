# Team Server App Stage Management Epic Description in Table Format

| **Section** | **Description** | **Questions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Project Name** | Team Server App Stage Management - Automated Deployment and Testing Platform |  |
| **Problem Statement** | Development and QA teams face significant delays and inefficiencies in application deployment and testing: • 30-60 minutes deployment time for each QA test • Manual deployment processes requiring developer assistance • 1-2 hour delays from task completion to testing start • Risk of deploying non-working versions to test environments • No automated rollback mechanisms • Lack of quality gates before deployment | _What problem are we solving?_ Eliminating deployment bottlenecks and manual processes in testing workflow _Who is affected and how?_ • Developers - blocked by deployment requests • QA teams - waiting for deployments • Team productivity - lost hours per sprint _What specific issue is being solved?_ Manual deployment process causing delays and errors _Who are the stakeholders affected?_ All R&D teams needing test environments |
| **Background & Context** | Currently, teams rely on manual deployment processes for testing, requiring coordination between developers and QA. Each deployment takes 30-60 minutes, creating bottlenecks and delays. With multiple developers working in parallel, the situation becomes unmanageable without an automated solution. | _From where we started?_ Manual deployments for each testing cycle _What led to the current situation?_ • Growing team size and parallel development • Increased deployment frequency • Need for rapid iteration and testing • Manual processes not scaling with team growth |
| **Goal & Criteria. Proposed Solution** | **Goal:** Create an automated stage management system enabling instant deployments and testing **Achievement criteria:** 1. Zero-time deployment for QA (instant availability) 2. 15-minute maximum update time for stages 3. Automatic quality gates preventing bad deployments 4. Automated rollback on critical failures 5. Support for parallel team development **Proposed solution:** Two-stage system (DEV and QA) with automated deployment, quality gates, and rollback mechanisms | _What is the final goal?_ Instant, reliable deployments for testing _What is the expected result?_ • 45-90 minutes saved per task • 6-12 hours saved per sprint • Zero deployment failures • Immediate testing capability _What is the proposed approach?_ Automated stage management with quality protection |
| **Strategic Impact** | This project directly supports company's development efficiency and quality goals by: • Accelerating development cycles through instant deployments • Improving software quality with automated gates • Enabling parallel team development • Reducing operational overhead and manual work | _How does the project support strategy?_ • Development efficiency goals • Quality assurance automation • DevOps transformation • Team productivity targets _What benefits will it create?_ • Time savings (6-12 hours/sprint) • Reduced deployment errors • Faster time-to-market • Improved developer satisfaction |
| **Alternatives Considered** | • Continue manual deployments - unsustainable with team growth • Traditional CI/CD only - doesn't address instant availability need • Container orchestration (K8s) - too complex for team size • Multiple individual environments - resource intensive, hard to manage | _What other solutions were evaluated?_ Manual processes, traditional CI/CD, containerization _What are the trade-offs?_ • Complexity vs functionality • Resource usage vs convenience • Initial setup time vs long-term benefits • Team skills vs solution complexity |
| **Implementation Plan** | **Phase 1:** Core Infrastructure • Setup DEV and QA stages • Basic deployment automation • Health check implementation **Phase 2:** Quality Gates • Unit test integration (85% threshold) • Critical service checks • Database migration validation **Phase 3:** Rollback System • Automatic failure detection • Rollback triggers and process • Notification system **Phase 4:** Team Integration • Access management • Documentation and training • Monitoring dashboard | _What are the main stages?_ 1. Infrastructure setup 2. Quality gates 3. Rollback system 4. Team adoption _What are the timelines?_ • Phase 1: 2 weeks • Phase 2: 1 week • Phase 3: 1 week • Phase 4: 1 week |
| **Resource Requirements** | • **Teams:** DevOps team, Platform team, QA team representatives • **Infrastructure:** 2 dedicated servers (DEV and QA stages), database resources • **Tools:** CI/CD pipeline, monitoring tools (Grafana), notification system • **Budget:** Server costs + development time (internal resources) | _Which teams are needed?_ DevOps, Platform, QA representatives _What budget is required?_ Infrastructure costs + 5 weeks development _What is the timeline?_ 5 weeks total implementation |
| **Success Metrics & KPIs** | **Operational Metrics:** 1. Deployment time: From 30-60 min to 0 (instant) 2. Update time: Maximum 15 minutes 3. Deployment success rate: 99%+ 4. Rollback time: Under 5 minutes 5. Quality gate effectiveness: 95%+ bad deployment prevention **Business Impact:** • Time saved: 6-12 hours per sprint • Developer satisfaction: 30% improvement • QA efficiency: 50% increase • Deployment errors: 90% reduction | _Operational Metrics_ See detailed list _How will this impact business?_ • Direct time savings • Improved team morale • Faster feature delivery _How will this improve UX?_ • Instant testing capability • Reliable environments • Automated quality checks |
| **Stakeholders** | • **Affected by the project:** All development teams, QA engineers, DevOps • **Interested in the project:** Team leads, Product managers, CTO • **Having influence:** VP Engineering, Head of DevOps, Head of QA • **Key stakeholders:** - Project Owner/Assignee - Development Team Leads - QA Team Leads - DevOps team | _Who is affected?_ All teams using test environments _Who is interested?_ Management, Product teams _Who has influence?_ Technical leadership _Key stakeholders?_ See list |

## Additional Information

### Current Pain Points
- **Manual Deployment Time:** 30-60 minutes per deployment
- **Developer Assistance Required:** QA blocked waiting for developers
- **Total Delay:** 1-2 hours from task completion to testing start
- **Sprint Impact:** Multiple hours lost per sprint on deployments

### Proposed Architecture
- **DEV Stage:** Continuous deployment from trunk/main for developer testing
- **QA Stage:** Controlled updates for QA testing (1-2 times per week)
- **Quality Gates:** Automated checks before deployment
- **Rollback System:** Automatic rollback on critical failures

### Quality Gate Requirements
1. **Unit Tests:** 85% pass rate minimum
2. **Critical Services:** Database and Redis availability
3. **Database Migrations:** Must complete successfully
4. **Health Checks:** All endpoints must respond

### Rollback Triggers
- Database unavailable (3 attempts, 10-second intervals)
- Redis unavailable (3 attempts, 10-second intervals)
- Health check failures on critical endpoints

### Expected Time Savings
- **Per Task:** 45-90 minutes saved
- **Per Sprint:** 6-12 hours saved
- **ROI:** Payback within first sprint

### Open Questions to Address
1. Multi-framework support (.NET Framework, .NET 8, multiple databases)
2. Branch synchronization strategy for parallel development
3. Backup and recovery procedures
4. QA stage update frequency and coordination
5. Definition of Done criteria for stage testing
6. Small change handling (avoid frequent updates)
7. Compilation resource management
8. Incident response for broken QA stage
9. Team training and support procedures

### Monitoring and Observability
- Grafana dashboard with key metrics
- Current version tracking
- Uptime monitoring
- Resource usage (CPU/Memory)
- Deployment history and rollback logs

### Security Considerations
- Limited access (5 team members maximum)
- Trust-based model within team
- Audit logging for all deployments
- Secure credential management
