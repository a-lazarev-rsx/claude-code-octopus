# Frontend Code Quality Check

Run comprehensive code quality checks (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, build) on all frontend files in the project.

This command will:

1. Run ESLint for code quality and potential errors on all frontend files
2. Run Prettier formatting check on all frontend files
3. Run TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit) on entire project
4. Run build to ensure code compiles successfully

All frontend files in the project will be checked.
