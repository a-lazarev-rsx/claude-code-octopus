# Agentic Code Review Orchestrator

Performs comprehensive code review by orchestrating multiple specialized sub-agents working in parallel.

## Instructions:

1. **Determine target branch**:

   **IMPORTANT**: Check if user provided target branch in arguments: $ARGUMENTS

   - If $ARGUMENTS is empty or not provided:
     * Ask the user: "–í –∫–∞–∫—É—é –≤–µ—Ç–∫—É –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –º–µ—Ä–∂? (–ù–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä: main, develop, master)"
     * STOP execution and wait for user response
     * User should re-run the command as: `/code-review:agentic-code-review <target-branch>`

   - If $ARGUMENTS contains a branch name:
     * Use the provided branch as target_branch
     * Continue with the review process

2. Gather git context for all sub-agents (using the determined target_branch):
   - Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
   - Verify target branch exists: !`git rev-parse --verify $ARGUMENTS 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --verify origin/$ARGUMENTS 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR: Branch not found"`
   - Parent branch detection: !`git merge-base HEAD $ARGUMENTS 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD origin/$ARGUMENTS 2>/dev/null || echo ""`
   - List commits: !`git log --oneline HEAD --not $(git merge-base HEAD $(git rev-parse --verify origin/$ARGUMENTS 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --verify $ARGUMENTS))`
   - Get full diff: !`git diff $(git merge-base HEAD $(git rev-parse --verify origin/$ARGUMENTS 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --verify $ARGUMENTS))...HEAD`
   - File statistics: !`git diff --stat $(git merge-base HEAD $(git rev-parse --verify origin/$ARGUMENTS 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --verify $ARGUMENTS))...HEAD`

3. Launch all sub-agents in parallel with the gathered context:

Task(
  description="Code quality review",
  subagent_type="code-quality-reviewer",
