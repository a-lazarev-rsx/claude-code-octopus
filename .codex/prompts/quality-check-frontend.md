# Frontend Code Quality Check

Run comprehensive code quality checks (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, build) on all frontend files in the project.

## Instructions:
1. Run ESLint for code quality and potential errors on all frontend files
2. Run Prettier formatting check on all frontend files
3. Run TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit) on entire project
4. Run build to ensure code compiles successfully

## Note:
All frontend files in the project will be checked.

Use appropriate npm/yarn/pnpm commands based on project's package manager.
