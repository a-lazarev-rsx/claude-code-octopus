# Frontend Code Quality Check

Run code quality checks (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, build) on changed frontend files in the project.

## Instructions:
1. Check for modified frontend files using git (ts, tsx, js, jsx)
2. Run ESLint for code quality and potential errors
3. Run Prettier formatting check
4. Run TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit)
5. Run build to ensure code compiles successfully

## Note:
Only files that have been modified (staged or unstaged) will be checked.

Use appropriate npm/yarn/pnpm commands based on project's package manager.
