# Agentic Code Review Orchestrator

Performs comprehensive code review by orchestrating multiple specialized sub-agents working in parallel.

## Instructions:

1. First, gather git context for all sub-agents:
   - Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
   - Parent branch detection: !`git merge-base --fork-point main HEAD 2>/dev/null || git merge-base --fork-point master HEAD 2>/dev/null || git merge-base --fork-point develop HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo ""`
   - List commits: !`git log --oneline HEAD --not $(git merge-base HEAD $(git branch -r | grep -E 'origin/(main|master|develop)' | head -1 | sed 's/origin\///'))`
   - Get full diff: !`git diff $(git merge-base HEAD $(git branch -r | grep -E 'origin/(main|master|develop)' | head -1 | sed 's/origin\///'))...HEAD`
   - File statistics: !`git diff --stat $(git merge-base HEAD $(git branch -r | grep -E 'origin/(main|master|develop)' | head -1 | sed 's/origin\///'))...HEAD`

2. Launch all sub-agents in parallel with the gathered context:

Task(
  description="Code quality review",
  subagent_type="code-quality-reviewer",
  prompt=f"""Review code quality for the following changes:
  
  Branch: {current_branch} ‚Üí {parent_branch}
  Commits: {commits_list}
  
  DIFF:

  {file_stats}
  
  IMPORTANT: For EVERY issue found, you MUST provide:
  1. The problematic code snippet
  2. The complete fixed/improved code snippet
  3. Clear explanation of the fix
  
  Use this format for each issue:
  **Issue**: [description]
  **Location**: [file:line]
  
  **Current code**:
  ```language

  IMPORTANT: For EVERY performance issue found, you MUST provide:
  1. The slow/inefficient code snippet
  2. The complete optimized implementation

  IMPORTANT: For EVERY testing gap found, you MUST provide:
  1. The untested code

3. Aggregate results from all sub-agents and present a unified report:

## Final Report Format:

### Executive Summary
